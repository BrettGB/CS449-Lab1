# CS449-Lab1
Umpire Buddy 2.0

Brett Barnow

For lab #2, add the following functionality to Umpire Buddy:

There are 2 events that you must check for: If the batter strikes out, or walks. The umpire buddy should perform as follows, based on which event occurs first:

If the number of strikes == 3, then the batter has struck out. A popup should appear that says "Out!" The popup will need a button or icon to clear it--any built-in functionality in the message window is fine for this.
If the number of balls == 4, then the batter should walk. A popup should appear that says "Walk!" Again, you will need a way to close this window.
In either case, the Umpire Buddy should not allow any more balls or strikes to be recorded; everything except the reset button should be disabled.
Also add an "About" button showing a new screen or window, containing the name of the program (Umpire Buddy 2.0), and your name.
