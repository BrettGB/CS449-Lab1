# CS449-Lab1
Umpire Buddy 1.0

BRETT GRAYSON BARNOW

For lab #1, implement Umpire Buddy, version 1.0. 

This is a simple Android app with a single window and 2 data items. The app is for baseball umpires to keep track of the balls and strikes for each batter. It needs 2 counters, 1 for balls and 1 for strikes, and the following interface features:

It should display the current count of each (and of course, it should be clear which is which).

A button for each that increments that counter by one and updates the display.

A 'Reset' button that restores both counters to 0 and updates the display accordingly.

An 'Exit' button to end the app.

Set up the project in GitHub. Include screen shots of your app working, either on an actual android device or an emulator.

Submit a link to GitHub.
